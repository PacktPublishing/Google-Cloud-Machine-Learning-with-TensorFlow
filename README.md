Google Cloud Machine Learning with TensorFlow, published by Packt publishing
This is the code repository for [Google Cloud Machine Learning with TensorFlow]( https://www.packtpub.com/data/google-cloud-machine-learning-with-tensorflow-video), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the video course from start to finish.
## About the Video Course
TensorFlow has become the first choice for deep learning tasks because of the way it facilitates building powerful and sophisticated neural networks. The Google Cloud Platform is a great place to run TF models at scale, and perform distributed training and prediction.

This course shows you how to use Google Cloud to train TensorFlow models and use them to predict results for multiple users. You will learn to efficiently train neural networks using large datasets and to serve your training models.

With this video course, you will use the power of Google's Cloud Platform to train deep neural networks faster. This course supplies various examples of training in Google Cloud AI Platform. You will also learn to run predictions for your model using the cloud. You will explore topics such as cloud infrastructures, distributed training, serverless technologies, model serving, and more.

By the end of the course, you will be expert at training and serving neural models, and beyond.
